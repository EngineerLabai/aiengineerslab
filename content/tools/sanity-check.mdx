<Formula label="Unit-aware evaluation">
Result = f(variables with units)
</Formula>

The lab evaluates formulas with a unit system. If you provide an expected unit, it checks dimensional consistency and flags mismatches.

**Assumptions**
- Units follow the MathJS unit system.
- Angular units (rad) are treated as dimensionless.

**Units**
- Supports SI and common engineering units (N, m, Pa, W, Hz, rpm, etc.).

**References**
- ISO 80000 (Quantities and units)
- MathJS unit reference

## Examples

### Example 1: Power from torque and speed

**Inputs**
- T = 10 N·m
- ω = 100 rad/s
- Formula: P = T · ω

**Outputs**
- P = 1000 W

### Example 2: Power from force and velocity

**Inputs**
- F = 200 N
- v = 0.5 m/s
- Formula: P = F · v

**Outputs**
- P = 100 W
