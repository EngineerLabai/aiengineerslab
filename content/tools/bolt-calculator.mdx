## Calculation Explanation

<Callout type="info" title="How to use?">
<StepList title="Quick steps" steps={["Select a bolt size and grade", "Set preload percentage and friction", "Read stress area, preload, and torque"]} />
</Callout>

<Formula label="Stress area, preload, torque">
As = (π/4) · (d - 0.9382·P)^2
Fv = (preload% / 100) · Re · As
T = K · Fv · (d / 1000)
</Formula>

**Assumptions**
- ISO metric thread profile is used for the stress area.
- Nut factor K is a lumped friction factor (dry/oiled/coated).
- Preload is based on yield strength Re; joint stiffness is neglected.

**Units**
- d, P: mm
- Re: MPa (N/mm²)
- As: mm²
- Fv: kN
- T: N·m

**References**
- VDI 2230 (Systematic calculation of bolted joints)
- ISO 898-1 (Mechanical properties of fasteners)
- ISO 68-1 (Thread profile)

<Callout type="warning" title="Out of scope / Warning">
This is not a full bolted joint analysis. Dynamic loading, gasketed joints, relaxation, and lubrication changes require a detailed joint calculation.

## Examples

### Example 1: M8 dry joint

**Inputs**
- d = 8 mm, P = 1.25 mm
- Grade: 8.8 (Re = 640 MPa)
- Preload: 70%
- Friction K: 0.25 (dry)

**Outputs**
- As = 36.61 mm²
- Fv = 16.40 kN
- T = 32.8 N·m

### Example 2: M10 oiled joint

**Inputs**
- d = 10 mm, P = 1.5 mm
- Grade: 10.9 (Re = 940 MPa)
- Preload: 70%
- Friction K: 0.20 (oiled)

**Outputs**
- As = 57.99 mm²
- Fv = 38.16 kN
- T = 76.3 N·m
