## Problem / Objective

In bearing selection, the goal is to identify a bearing type that balances load and speed requirements.

## Assumptions

- Load distribution is assumed to be balanced.
- Lubrication and temperature conditions are within typical production ranges.
- Assembly tolerances are inside catalog limits.

## Step by step method

<StepList
  title="Fast selection flow"
  steps={["Define load and speed range", "Note operating temperature", "Calculate service factors", "Select bearing type"]}
/>

## Common mistakes

<Callout type="info" title="Checkpoint">
Skipping service factors in quick selection can dramatically reduce bearing life.
</Callout>

- Mixing radial and axial loads.
- Ignoring weak lubrication conditions.
- Assuming service factor equals 1.
